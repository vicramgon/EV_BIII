abstract = {Finding good solutions for Multi-objective Optimization (MOPs) Problems is considered a hard problem, especially when considering MOPs with constraints. Thus, most of the works in the context of MOPs do not explore in-depth how different constraints affect the performance of MOP solvers. Here, we focus on exploring the effects of different Constraint Handling Techniques (CHTs) on MOEA/D, a commonly used MOP solver when solving complex real-world MOPs. Moreover, we introduce a simple and effective CHT focusing on the exploration of the decision space, the Three Stage Penalty. We explore each of these CHTs in MOEA/D on two simulated MOPs and six analytic MOPs (eight in total). The results of this work indicate that while the best CHT is problem-dependent, our new proposed Three Stage Penalty achieves competitive results and remarkable performance in terms of hypervolume values in the hard simulated car design MOP.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an improved epsilon constraint handling method embedded in the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) to solve constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs). More specifically, it dynamically adjusts the epsilon level, which is a critical parameter in the epsilon constraint method, according to the feasible ratio of solutions in the current population. In order to verify the effect of the improved epsilon constraint handling method, three algorithms - MOEA/D-CDP, MOEA/D-Epsilon, and MOEA/D-IEpsilon (MOEA/D with the improved epsilon constraint handling mechanism) are tested on nine CMOPs (CMOP1-CMOP9). The comprehensive experimental results indicate that the proposed epsilon constraint handling method is very effective on the performance of both convergence and diversity.},

@inproceedings{Asafuddoula2012,
abstract = {This paper proposes an efficient, adaptive constraint handling approach that can be used within the class of evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms. The proposed constraint handling approach is presented within the framework of one of the most successful algorithms i.e. multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) [1]. The constraint handling mechanism adaptively decides on the violation threshold for comparison. The violation threshold is based on the type of constraints, size of the feasible space and the search outcome. Such a process intrinsically treats constraint violation and objective function values separately and adds a selection pressure, wherein infeasible solutions with violations less than the identified threshold are considered at par with feasible solutions. As illustrated, the constraint handling scheme extends the current capability of MOEA/D to deal with constraints. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated using 10 commonly studied benchmark problems and a real-world constraint optimization problem, and compared with the results obtained using yet another commonly used form i.e. Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

@article{Yang2020,
abstract = {Constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) are common in real-world engineering application, and are difficult to solve because of the conflicting nature of the objectives and many constraints. Some constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) have been developed for CMOPs, but they still suffer from the problems of easily getting trapped into local optimal solutions and low convergence. This paper introduces a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition and dynamic constraint-handling mechanism (MOEA/D-DCH) to tackle this issue. Firstly, the dynamic constraint-handling mechanism divides the search modes into the unconstrained search mode and the constrained search mode, which are dynamically adjusted by the generation number and the proportion of feasible solutions in the population. This mechanism could lead to a faster convergence than the traditional constraint-handling mechanisms. For the constrained search mode, an improved epsilon constraint-handling method is used to enhance the diversity of the population. Then, an individual update mechanism based on the best feasible solution of each sub-problem is designed to update the feasible individuals for maintaining the convergence of the feasible solutions. Finally, MOEA/D-DCH dynamically regulates the parameters of the differential evolution operator to enhance the local search ability. Experiments on 21 benchmark test functions are conducted to test MOEA/D-DCH and five other typical CMOEAs. Meanwhile, a real-world problem is employed to evaluate the practical performance of MOEA/D-DCH. MOEA/D-DCH achieves significantly better results than the other five algorithms on most of the test problems. The results indicate the effectiveness and competitiveness of MOEA/D-DCH for solving CMOPs.},

@inproceedings{Zhu2019,
abstract = {Decomposition-based constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms decompose a constrained multiobjective problem into a set of constrained single-objective subproblems. For each subproblem, the aggregation function and the overall constraint violation need to be minimized simultaneously, which however may conflict with each other during the evolutionary process. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a novel decomposition-based constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm with two types of weight vectors, respectively emphasizing convergence and diversity. The solutions associated to the convergence weight vectors are updated only considering the aggregation function in order to search the whole search space freely, while the ones associated to the diversity weight vectors are renewed by considering both the aggregation function and the overall constraint violation, which encourages to search around the feasible region found so far. Once the replacement of solutions does not happen for the diversity weight vectors in a period, the corresponding diversity weight vectors will be transferred to convergence one. Thereafter, all solutions will finally search around the feasible region, which helps to find more feasible or superior solutions. The proposed constraint handling technique can have a good balance to search the feasible and infeasible regions and show the promising performance, which is validated when tackling several constrained multi-objective problems.},
